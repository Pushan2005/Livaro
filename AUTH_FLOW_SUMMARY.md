# Authentication & Onboarding Flow - Fixed âœ…

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Auth Routes âœ…
- **Problem**: Had both `src/app/auth/` and `src/app/(auth)/` directories causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed `src/app/auth/` directory and consolidated everything under `src/app/(auth)/`

### 2. Middleware Configuration âœ…
- **Problem**: Middleware matcher was excluding `auth/*` but not `(auth)/*` route groups
- **Solution**: Updated middleware matcher to properly exclude `(auth)/` pattern

### 3. Callback Route Conflicts âœ…
- **Problem**: Two different callback handlers with different logic
- **Solution**: Kept the more robust `(auth)/callback/route.ts` with proper error handling

### 4. Next.js Build Cache Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: `.next/server/pages/_document.js` error due to corrupted cache
- **Solution**: Cleared `.next` directory and rebuilt application

### 5. Removed Problematic Components âœ…
- **Problem**: `GoogleOneTap` component was causing session conflicts
- **Solution**: Simplified sign-in page with standard OAuth flow

### 6. Fixed Redirect Loop Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: All authenticated users were being redirected to `/messages` regardless of onboarding status
- **Solution**: Added proper onboarding check in landing page - only redirect onboarded users to `/messages`

### 7. Integrated Onboarding Gate âœ…
- **Problem**: OnboardingGate was only in `(main-layout)` but users were redirected before reaching it
- **Solution**: Moved `ClientWrapper` (containing OnboardingGate) to root layout for all pages

## Current Auth Flow

### 1. Unauthenticated Users
- Can access: `/`, `/map`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/callback`, `/error`, `/confirm-email`
- Redirect to `/sign-in` for any other route

### 2. Authenticated Users (Not Onboarded)
- Middleware redirects them to `/` (landing page)
- Landing page shows with onboarding modal overlay
- OnboardingGate checks `/api/onboarding/status` and shows modal until completion

### 3. Authenticated Users (Onboarded)
- Landing page redirects them to `/messages`
- Can access all protected routes normally
- Sign-in page redirects them directly to `/messages`

## Middleware Logic

```typescript
// Unauthenticated users: only allow public routes
if (!user) {
  const allowed = ['/', '/map', '/sign-in', '/sign-up', '/callback', '/error', '/confirm-email']
  if (!allowed.includes(pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/sign-in', request.url))
  }
}

// Authenticated users: check onboarding
if (!onboarded && pathname !== '/') {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url)) // Go to home for onboarding
}
// Onboarded users can access any route
```

## Landing Page Logic

```typescript
if (user) {
  // Check onboarding status in database
  const onboarded = !!userRow && !!customerRow;
  
  if (onboarded) {
    redirect('/messages'); // Only redirect onboarded users
  }
  // Non-onboarded users see landing page with onboarding modal
}
```

## Directory Structure

```
src/app/
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx                    # Root layout with ClientWrapper
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                     # Landing page with onboarding check
â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sign-in/page.tsx         # Redirects onboarded users to /messages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sign-up/page.tsx         # Registration form
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ callback/route.ts        # OAuth callback handler
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ error/page.tsx           # Auth error page
â”œâ”€â”€ (main-layout)/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx               # App layout (no longer has ClientWrapper)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                      # Protected app pages
â”œâ”€â”€ messages/                    # Main app destination
â””â”€â”€ api/onboarding/
    â”œâ”€â”€ status/route.ts          # Check onboarding status
    â””â”€â”€ complete/route.ts        # Save onboarding data
```

## Key Components

1. **OnboardingGate**: Now in root layout, checks onboarding status for all authenticated users
2. **OnboardingFlow**: Multi-step modal for user onboarding
3. **Middleware**: Routes users based on auth/onboarding status
4. **Landing Page**: Smart redirect logic based on onboarding completion

## Fixed Flow Examples

### New User Registration:
1. User registers â†’ redirected to `/`
2. Landing page sees non-onboarded user â†’ stays on page
3. OnboardingGate shows modal â†’ user completes onboarding
4. After completion â†’ redirected to `/messages`

### Returning Onboarded User:
1. User visits any protected page â†’ middleware allows access
2. User visits `/` â†’ landing page redirects to `/messages`
3. User visits `/sign-in` â†’ page redirects to `/messages`

### Returning Non-Onboarded User:
1. User visits protected page â†’ middleware redirects to `/`
2. Landing page shows with onboarding modal
3. User completes onboarding â†’ redirected to `/messages`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/onboarding/status` - Returns `{ onboarded: boolean }`
- `POST /api/onboarding/complete` - Saves user profile data

## Authentication Providers

- Email/Password (Supabase Auth)
- Google OAuth (redirects to `/callback`)

The authentication flow is now stable and properly handles all edge cases without redirect loops! ðŸŽ‰
